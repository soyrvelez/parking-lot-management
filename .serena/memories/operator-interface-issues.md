# Operator Interface Issues Summary

## 1. Current Status
The operator interface has significant gaps compared to the specification. While basic functionality exists, the UI/UX does not meet the requirements for a locked-down, touch-friendly, single-screen operation system.

## 2. Critical Issues Identified

### Layout Issues
- **FIXED**: ~~Sidebar navigation violates single-screen requirement~~ → Converted to tabbed navigation
- **FIXED**: ~~Multi-column layouts in payment section~~ → Single-column touch layout
- Payment confirmation still needs quick amount buttons

### Size & Touch Issues  
- **FIXED**: ~~Buttons too small (40-48px instead of required 80px+)~~ → New CSS classes with 80px+ heights
- **FIXED**: ~~Input fields too small for touch operation~~ → Enhanced scanner input with 8rem padding
- Status indicators need enlargement

### Input & Interaction Issues
- **FIXED**: ~~Scanner input not prominent enough~~ → Full-width blue-bordered input
- Keyboard shortcuts partially implemented (F1-F4 done, need F5-F12)
- No quick payment amount buttons (100, 200, 500 pesos)
- Enter key handling incomplete

### Technical Issues
- **FIXED**: ~~Decimal.js still used instead of Money class~~ → Money class integrated
- Hardware status hardcoded (printer/scanner always "Conectado")
- Error messages not consistently Spanish
- Loading states missing Spanish text

### Workflow Issues
- **FIXED**: ~~Pension customer lookup requires too much typing~~ → Plate-based search
- Payment flow requires manual amount entry instead of quick buttons
- No visual feedback for scanner input success
- Missing keyboard navigation between fields

## 3. Specification Requirements
- **Single-screen operation**: All functions accessible without navigation
- **Spanish UI**: 100% Mexican Spanish, no English text
- **Large buttons**: Minimum 80px height for all interactive elements  
- **Minimal typing**: Scanner primary input, quick buttons for common amounts
- **Touch-friendly**: Designed for ThinkPad trackpad operation
- **No authentication**: Operators access without login
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: F-keys for common operations

## 4. Priority
**CRITICAL**: Fix operator interface before any other work. This is the primary user-facing system that will be used hundreds of times daily.

## 5. Next Action
Systematic rebuild focusing on:
1. Complete keyboard shortcuts (F5-F12 for payment amounts)
2. Add quick payment buttons (100, 200, 500 pesos)
3. Implement real hardware status checks
4. Add visual feedback for all actions
5. Ensure 100% Spanish localization
6. Test complete operator workflows

The operator interface must be production-ready before moving to any other features.
