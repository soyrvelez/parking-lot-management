# Development Commit Frequency Workflow

## Established Pattern
- **Commit after each major component completion** - Preserve work at natural breakpoints
- **Commit before context clearing** - Prevent loss of development progress
- **Commit at development phase transitions** - Mark clear boundaries between phases
- **Use meaningful commit messages** - Include Spanish localization notes and technical highlights

## Branch Strategy
- `main` - Stable, production-ready code
- `feature/frontend-development` - Active frontend development branch
- Merge to main when frontend milestone is complete

## Commit Message Format
```
feat: [Component] [Description] with Spanish localization

- Bullet points of key features implemented
- Technical implementation notes
- Spanish localization highlights

Technical highlights:
- Decimal.js usage for financial calculations
- Mexico City timezone handling
- Hardware integration notes
